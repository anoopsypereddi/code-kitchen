# sc-send post-submit settle pause (SC_SEND_SETTLE).
#
# sc-send's success only proves the composer cleared - the Enter landed and the
# text was submitted. The harness then takes a beat to spin up the turn before its
# busy footer appears, so an immediate peek after sc-send returns would see the
# stale idle pane. sc-send therefore pauses SC_SEND_SETTLE seconds (default 1, 0
# disables) after a successful text submit, so the receiving turn has time to
# visibly start. These tests pin that behavior hermetically (stubbed tmux + sleep,
# no real agent):
#   1. A successful text send pauses for the SC_SEND_SETTLE value (default 1).
#   2. SC_SEND_SETTLE=0 produces no pause at all (sleep is never invoked for it).
#   3. The pause is tunable (SC_SEND_SETTLE=7 pauses 7).
#   4. The --key path never pauses (it bypasses the submit/settle path entirely).
